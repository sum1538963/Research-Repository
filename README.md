This Python script creates a colorful geometric design using the Turtle module.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included in standard Python installations)

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy and paste the provided Python code into a Python file (e.g., `colorful_turtle_design.py`).
3. Run the Python script.
4. A window will appear displaying the colorful geometric design drawn by the Turtle.

## Description
- The script creates a Turtle screen with a white background.
- A Turtle object is created and used to draw the geometric design.
- The design consists of 36 rotated squares.
- Each square has a side length of 100 units.
- The Turtle rotates by 10 degrees after drawing each square.
- The pen color is set to blue, and the pen thickness is set to 2.
- After drawing the design, the Turtle is hidden, and the drawing is displayed.

## Customization
- You can customize the script by adjusting parameters such as the number of squares, the side length of squares, the pen color, and the pen thickness.
- Experiment with different values to create your own unique designs!
